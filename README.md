## GenAI Citation Policy

Using AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to **learn concepts** does not require citation. Having AI **write larger code blocks** requires citing the source in a comment. AI-generated code without citation is plagiarism. Full AI-generated programs are fine from a plagiarism perspective if cited, but hurt the contribution grade. See [HSG GenAI rules](https://universitaetstgallen.sharepoint.com/sites/PruefungenDE/SitePages/Arbeiten-mit-KI.aspx) ([local copy](docs/references/writing-with-ai.md)).
